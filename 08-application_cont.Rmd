According to multinomial logit analysis, controlling for demographic conditions including age, education level, and household size, probability of being in lowerst quintile level is higher among parents and single parent household in most of the countries in the region. Households classified as couple with children also include grand parents and grand children and the share of female singe parents is bigger than male single parents. The finding shows that households with old or female caregivers may need more social protection to support their children as well as their own welfare.

There has been a global phenomenon that more people have access to mobile phones. South Asia region is no exception on this where a large share of poor people have access to mobile phones than to electricity or improved water. For all countries in the region, cell phone users have significantyl grew.Even among those who don't have access to electricity still have access to cell phone which implies lower entry barriers to obtain them.  

Why do they have rapid increase in cell phone usage?

What does it imply?
Effective usage of technology may help reduce poverty in developing countries most of which have difficulties in investing in public infrastructure. Also, the low participation in development projects have casted the issue of accessibility of aid programs to local people. With hight percentage of cell phone users, we can compensate the shortcomings of aid program especially in eduation, health and agriculture sectors by efficiently sharing knowledge with people.
